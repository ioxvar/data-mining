## Introduction
This repository contains RosettaAI's approach to the 2019 ACM Recys Challenge ([paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3359560), [writeup](https://medium.com/@huangkh19951228/the-5th-place-approach-to-the-2019-acm-recsys-challenge-by-team-rosettaai-eb3c4e6178c4)). Instead of treating it as a ranking problem, we use __Binary Cross Entropy__ as our loss function. Three different models were implemented:
1. Neural Networks (based on [DeepFM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04950.pdf) and this [Youtube paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45530.pdf))
2. LightGBM 
3. XGBoost



## Environment
* Ubuntu 16.04
* CUDA 9.0 
* Python==3.6.8
* Numpy==1.16
* Pandas==0.24.2
* PyTorch==1.1.0  
* Sklearn==0.21.2
* Scipy==1.3.0
* LightGBM==2.2.4
* XGBoost==0.9
* timezonefinder==4.0.3
* geopy==1.20.0

## Project Structure

```
├── input
├── output
├── src
└── weights
```

## Setup
Run the following commands to create directories that conform to the structure of the project, then place the unzipped data into the ```input``` directory.:

```. setup.sh```



Run the two python scripts to picklize the input data and obtain the utc offsets from countries:
```
cd src
python picklization.py
python country2utc.py
```

To enable the model to train on the whole data, set ```debug``` and ```subsample``` to ```False``` in the ```config.py``` file.

```
class Configuration(object):

    def __init__(self):
        ...
        self.debug = False
        self.sub_sample = False
        ...
```


## Training & Submission

The models are all trained in an end-to-end fashion. To train and predict each of the three models, simply run the following commands:
```
python run_nn.py
python run_lgb.py
python run_xgb.py
```
The submission files are stored in the ```output``` directory. 

The results generated from LightGBM alone would place us at the 5th position in the public leaderboard. To ensemble these three models, change the output name of each model in ```Merge.ipynb``` and run it.
